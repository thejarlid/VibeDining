# TODO

## short term 
[] scraping api
[] setup indexing on supabase with pgvector
[] Add data freshness
[] web api 
[] More deterministic graph-based agent
[] Need to make agent faster -> retrieval is too slow


## Longterm backlog
[] Add ability to have users
[] Users can upload and share their own maps lists
[] lists/agents can be shareable with friends
[] agent can have context to search over multiple lists or specific lists - default is all data for a user 
[] queue user's requests so we don't overload my openai limit
